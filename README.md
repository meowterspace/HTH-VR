# HTH-VR
This project was created for the 24 hour Hack the Holidays 2.0 VR project.
Fly through the skies on your magical sleigh, lead by the most majestic of reindeer. 
Python server running to grab Christmasy songs from the Spotify API to ensure maximum festivities.

# What is it and how do I play?
To save Christmas from HackyMcHackerface, you must destroy the evil presents filled with white bubbly coal (don't ask) that fly towards you.

Look towards the gift you want to destroy and the magic of Virtual Reality will propel a bauble of cheer in your direction, destroying the pseudo gift.

Certain festive songs will trigger the 'HyperCheer' drive in your sleigh, allowing you to travel at warp speed.
